** This auto-deployment system is based on Ansible Playbook. **
In this example, version 2.5 of Ansible is installed on a Ubuntu Linux, running on another NeCTAR instance.
** To run the auto-deployment, all the user has to run ./run-nectar.sh, and the file is in the deployment folder.**
- The first part is the Instance Creation.
- The second part is Installation and Running. 
  This part runs two Ansible plays on the instance to install and run different packages.
